# Study in the USA:

I am making documents that I used to apply for MS, PhD public through this directory. This is especially relevant to Nepalese students. Some of these documents are prepared in 2014. However, I decided to make them public so that people can use them as a template as per their needs. Though these documents can be generally useful, these documents will be more useful for agriculture, forestry, and related disciplines students from Nepal.
